        <h1>Green Energy Technologies</h1>
        <p>Green energy technologies are innovations and systems that create, distribute, or store energy while minimizing detrimental effects on the environment.</p>
        <p>Their primary goal is to reduce emissions, conserve resources, and increase overall efficiency by utilizing renewable or clean sources of energy rather than fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Transforming Matter: They convert physical resources‚Äîlike sunlight, wind, water, or biomass‚Äîinto usable forms of energy.Reducing Harmful Matter: By cutting reliance on fossil fuels, they decrease the emission of pollutants such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulates.</p>

        <h1>Carbon Capture & Climate Solutions</h1>
        <p>Carbon capture refers to a group of technologies that prevent carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions from entering the atmosphere. </p>
        <p>apture CO‚ÇÇ from sources like power plants, cement, and steel factories.Transport the CO‚ÇÇ (by pipeline, ship, or other means).Store it deep underground or repurpose it into valuable materials</p>

        <h1>Sustainable Agriculture & Conservation</h1>
        <p>Sustainable agriculture and conservation refer to farming and land management practices that maintain productivity while preserving environmental health, supporting biodiversity, and benefiting society. </p>
        <p>These systems actively manage the flow, transformation, and stewardship of matter‚Äîfrom nutrients in soil to water, carbon, and living organisms‚Äîreshaping how resources cycle through the environment.</p>
        <p>Carbon Sequestration: Conservation tillage and agroforestry ‚Äúlock‚Äù atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ as organic carbon in soils and vegetation, transforming greenhouse gases into stable matter and supporting climate goals.</p>
